# Production Module BOM Validation & Stock Updates - Implementation Plan

## Current Status
- ✅ Server has BOM validation endpoint (`/api/production/validate-bom`)
- ✅ Frontend has production planning UI with incomplete functions
- ❌ Frontend calls undefined `validateBOM()` and `updateInventoryStock()` functions
- ❌ Server missing stock update endpoints for production workflow

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Frontend Functions Implementation
- [x] Implement `validateBOM(bom)` function in ProductionPlanning.jsx
  - Call server `/api/production/validate-bom` endpoint
  - Handle API response and validation results
  - Return success/error with detailed messages
- [x] Implement `updateInventoryStock(material, quantity)` function
  - Call new server endpoint to deduct materials
  - Handle API response and errors
  - Update local state after successful API call

### Phase 2: Server Stock Update Endpoints
- [x] Add `/api/production/update-stock` endpoint
  - Accept material name and quantity to deduct
  - Update inventory stock levels
  - Return success/error with updated stock info
- [x] Add `/api/production/complete-stock` endpoint
  - Accept product name and quantity to add
  - Update inventory with finished products
  - Return success/error with updated stock info

### Phase 3: Integration & Error Handling
- [x] Update `handleStartProduction` function
  - Call `validateBOM()` before starting production
  - Only proceed if validation succeeds
  - Show user-friendly error messages for insufficient materials
- [x] Update `handleCompleteOrder` function
  - Call stock update to add finished products to inventory
  - Handle completion errors gracefully
- [x] Add comprehensive error handling
  - Network errors
  - Server errors
  - Insufficient stock scenarios
  - User notifications for all error cases

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test BOM validation with sufficient materials
- [ ] Test BOM validation with insufficient materials
- [ ] Test stock deduction when production starts
- [ ] Test stock addition when production completes
- [ ] Test error scenarios and user feedback
- [ ] Verify inventory levels update correctly
- [ ] Test complete production workflow end-to-end

## Dependencies
- Frontend: ProductionPlanning.jsx
- Backend: server/index.js (inventoryItems array, production endpoints)
- Data: initialData.js (BOM structure, inventory data)

## Risk Assessment
- **Low**: Changes are isolated to production module
- **Medium**: Stock updates could affect inventory accuracy if not handled properly
- **Low**: API integration follows existing patterns in the codebase

## Success Criteria
- BOM validation works correctly before production starts
- Stock levels update properly when production starts and completes
- Users receive clear feedback for validation failures
- No production can start with insufficient materials
- Inventory accuracy is maintained throughout production workflow

## Additional Issues Found
- [x] BOM creation in create form needs improvement
  - [x] Product selection should auto-populate BOM based on product type
  - [x] Need to define BOM templates for each product
  - [x] Add BOM display in create form for user visibility
- [ ] Error handling improvements needed
  - Better user feedback for validation failures
  - Loading states during API calls
  - Rollback mechanism if stock update fails
- [ ] Data synchronization
  - Frontend inventory state needs to sync with server after stock updates
  - Real-time inventory updates in UI

## Recently Completed Tasks
- [x] Updated product selection dropdown to use handleProductSelection function
- [x] Added BOM display section in create form showing auto-populated materials
- [x] Implemented BOM templates for 'Headphone Nirkabel' and 'Smartwatch' products
- [x] Added stock level checking and sufficiency indicators in BOM display
