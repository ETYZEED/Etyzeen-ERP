## ❌ Blocked Activities (System Constraints)

### Testing Dependencies Installation
- Cannot install @testing-library/react, @testing-library/jest-dom
- Cannot install jest-environment-jsdom, user-event
- **Reason:** Insufficient disk space (ENOSPC error)

### Live Testing Execution
- Cannot start React development server
- Cannot perform manual browser testing
- Cannot execute automated unit tests
- **Reason:** System disk space constraints

## 🎯 Next Steps & Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)
1. **Resolve Disk Space Issue**
   - Target: 2GB+ free space required
   - Clean temporary files, cache, old logs
   - Consider moving project to different drive

2. **Install Testing Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
   npm install --save-dev @testing-library/user-event jest-environment-jsdom
